# Pre-2016 website

## Overview
This repository is the transaction portion of the website originally authored by Jeffery Nicholls.

The purpose of this website was to provide an area outside the wikimedia.ca wiki for Paypal transactions such as joining the organization or making a donation.

The folders contain the original Paypal button graphics with their original labels.

The site had several issues:

* The Paypal buttons all had the same `alt` text. Non-visual users had no way to distinguish the "Donate" button from the "Join" button.
* The webpages were not correctly tagged for their language (English or French).
* The French webpage used Unicode characters without a specified `charset`.

This site was replaced in the fall of 2016.
